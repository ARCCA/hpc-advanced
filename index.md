This workshop introduces more advanced topics to using high-performance computing systems effectively. We
obviously can't cover every case or give an exhaustive course on supercomputing in just 4 hours
of teaching time. Instead, this workshop is intended to give students a good basis and
overview of the tools available and how to use them effectively.

By the end of this workshop, students will know how to:

* Understand how to use development tools more effectively such as the commandline, editors, revision control systems, and build systems.
* Debugging code with useful compiler options, debugging tools including GDB, Pdb (for Python), ARM Forge, Intel Thread
  Checker
* Optimising code with GPUs, efficient filesystem access and profiling code.
